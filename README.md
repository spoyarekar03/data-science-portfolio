# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only.

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally

1. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server/Vscode etc.
2. Update the path to the data directory as per your local setup.

## Contents
- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Sales for Advertisement](https://github.com/spoyarekar03/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Supervised_Regression/Predicting%20Sales%20for%20Advertising.ipynb): The developed model predicts the overall revenue increase after advertising through various mediums.

	- [Mobile price prediction](https://github.com/spoyarekar03/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Supervised_Classificiation/Mobile_price_prediction_using_Classification.ipynb): The developed model predicts a price range of mobiles, indicating the variation in the prices using different Machine Learning algorithms.

	- [Customer Segmentation and Analysis](https://github.com/spoyarekar03/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Unsupervised_Learning): The purpose of this code is to perform customer segmentation based on their spending habits and demographics. The code utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to categorize customers into different groups and identify patterns and trends in their behavior. 

 - ### Other Projects   

	- [Linear regression](https://github.com/spoyarekar03/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Other%20projects/Linear_regression/Ecommerce%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb): The developed model predict company's decision for improving user experience on mobile or website.

	- [Logistic regression](https://github.com/spoyarekar03/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Other%20projects/Logistic_regression/Predicting_Survival_using_Logistic_regression.ipynb): The developed model predicts the Survival of Titanic Passengers.

	- [KNN Classification](https://github.com/spoyarekar03/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Other%20projects/KNN/Drug_classification_using%20KNN.ipynb): The developed model predicts the classification of drug for various parameter.

	- [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/spoyarekar03/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Other%20projects/SVM/Credit_risk_SVM.ipynb): The developed model predicts the eligibility of a candidate for a loan.

	- [Decision Tree](https://github.com/spoyarekar03/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Other%20projects/Decision_Tree/Chance_of_admission_DT.ipynb): The developed model predicts the chance of admission for any candidate.
	
	- [Random Forest](https://github.com/spoyarekar03/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Other%20projects/Random_Forest/Taxifare_RandomF_Regressor.ipynb): The developed model predicts the taxi fare for customers.
	
	- [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/spoyarekar03/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Other%20projects/Naive_Bayes/Mobile_Price_Naive_Bayes_Gaussian.ipynb): The developed model predicts the price range for purchasing a mobile.
