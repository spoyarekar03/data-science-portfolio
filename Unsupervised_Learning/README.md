The purpose of this code is to perform customer segmentation based on their spending habits and demographics. The code utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to categorize customers into different groups and identify patterns and trends in their behavior. 

The code begins by importing necessary libraries and reading the customer data from a CSV file. It then performs data exploration and preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and checking for special characters. The data is then visualized using various plots to gain insights into the customer segments.

Next, the code generates arrays of features and applies the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. It then performs K-means clustering on the data and assigns customers to specific clusters based on their spending scores and annual incomes. The clusters are visualized using scatter plots.

The code also includes a separate analysis to find the relationship between age and spending score. Again, the elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and K-means clustering is applied to categorize customers based on age and spending score.

In conclusion, this code provides a comprehensive analysis of customer segmentation and offers valuable insights into different customer groups. The results can be used to inform marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and optimize business decisions for long-term success.
